        <ol class="rcp-lists">Preparation:

            <li>Before you begin making the dough, grease oil on an idli pan or a steamer pan and keep ready.</li>

            <li>If you have banana leaves then cut them in squares and place them on the idli moulds. Grease the banana
                leaves with some oil.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol class="rcp-lists">Roasting Rice Flour for Idiyappam recipe:
            <li>Heat a kadai or pan. Keep the flame to a low and add 1 cup rice flour (130 grams).</li>

            <li>On a low flame stirring often roast the rice flour for 4 to 5 minutes. You don't need to brown the
                flour.
                Its just lightly roasted and this helps in making soft idiyappams.</li>

            <li>Continue to stir and roast till you see steam coming from the rice flour.</li>

            <li>When you see steam appearing from the rice flour, then switch off the flame. Remove the rice flour in a
                mixing bowl or pan.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol class="rcp-lists">Kneading:
            <li>In the same kadai or pan in which rice flour was roasted, add 1.25 to 1.3 cups water.</li>

            <li>Add Â¼ teaspoon salt.</li>

            <li>Let the water come to a boil. The water has to be hot but should not be very hot. Do not allow it to
                come to
                a rolling boil. When you see tiny bubbles appearing in the water and it begins to start boiling, thats
                the
                time you switch off the flame.</li>

            <li>Then add the hot water in the rice flour.</li>

            <li>Begin to mix with a spoon or spatula. mix very well.</li>

            <li>Keep on mixing and when the heat is tolerable then you can begin to knead. If you cannot knead then wait
                for
                1 to 2 minutes and when the heat can be tolerated then start kneading. Do note that the dough has to be
                hot
                when you knead.</li>

            <li>Knead to a smooth and soft dough. If the dough looks dry then you can sprinkle some warm water on it and
                continue to knead. If the dough become sticky then add a few tablespoons rice flour and knead.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol class="rcp-lists">Making Idiyappam:
            <li>Take the disc meant for making the idiyappam and spread some water or oil on it.</li>

            <li>Also before you start making idiyappam, heat 2 cups water in a pan or pressure cooker and let it come to
                a
                boil. Keep water on low to medium flame.</li>

            <li>Divide the dough into 2to3 portions. Prepare a log from one portion and place it in the
                idiyappam/murukku
                maker. Grease the idiyappam maker with some oil or water before you place the dough in it. Cover the
                rest of
                the dough with a kitchen napkin so that they don't dry out.</li>

            <li>Now begin to press the idiyappam/murukku maker directly on the idli moulds in a concentric round circle.
            </li>

            <li>Form one roundel of the idiyappam.</li>

            <li>While making idiyappams, the dough has to be hot or warm.</li>

            <li>This way continue to make idiyappams on all the idli moulds.</li>

            <li>Sprinkle some grated coconut on top of each idiappam. Coconut is optional and can be skipped.
                Alternatively
                you can sprinkle fresh grated coconut and sugar just before serving.</li>

            <li>Now place the idli stand in the pan.</li>

            <li>Cover pan with a lid. If using pressure cooker, then remove the whistle (vent weight) and cover the
                cooker.
            </li>

            <li>On medium to high flame steam idiyappams for 9 to 10 minutes. After they are cooked well, switch off the
                flame and let the idiyappams be inside the steamer pan for 1 to 2 minutes.</li>

            <li>Then remove the idli stand from the pan. Remove the idiyappams with a spatula and serve the idiyappam.
            </li>

            <li>If you have used banana leaves then you just need to pick up the banana leaves and serve. If not serving
                immediately then place the idiappam in a casserole so that they stay warm.</li>

            <li>Serve idiyappam or nool puttu with veg korma, potato korma, mushroom korma, veg stew or potato stew or
                jaggery sweetened coconut milk.</li>
