        <li> Drethug </li>
        <li> Thuppa </li>
    </ul>

        <li> 2 tbsp mustard oil</li>
        <li>3 spring onions, chopped</li>
        <li>8-10 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
        <li>3 tomatoes. chopped</li>
        <li>11/2 tsp cummin powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp garam masala</li>
        <li>1 tsp freshly cracked black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup spinach, chopped</li>
        <li>3 radishes, chopped</li>
        <li>4 1/2 cups water</li>
        <li>3 cups wheat flour</li>
        <li>1 egg for making paape(kind of wheate pasta)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup spring onion greens, chopped</li>
        <li>1/4 cup coriander</li>
        <li>1 tsp lemon juice</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>In a heavy pan, or preferably a copper pot, heat lots of mustard oil until hot and smoky.</li>
        <li>Add the onions and garlic and saute until onions are translucent. Then add the chopped tomatoes and cook for
            three to four minutes or until tomatoes are soft and mushy. Now add cuin powder, garam masala and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>Add chopped spinach and radish and saute for two minutes. Top it up with four cups of water and bring to
            boil. Immediately lower the heat and let it simmer. Meanwhile, prepare the pasta-like paape.</li>
        <li>Mix flour with egg and half cup of water. Add water in parts while kneading to ensure there isn't too much
            of it. When it is nicely kneaded, roll out the dough like a roti and make paapes out of it. Keep adding
            these irregular bite-sized dough strips into the simmering broth, as you tear them. Now, cook for another 10
            minutes.</li>
        <li>Add little salt, garnish with coriander and spring onion leaves and serve hot!
        </li>
        <strong>Tip:</strong>if you cook thukpa in brass handi, you will get a different taste and it will not get
        spoilt easily!
    </ol>
