        <h4>Undhiyu is a one pot vegetable casserole dish that is the hallmark of Gujarati vegetarian cuisine.</h4>
        <p>Undhiyu is so called as it is derived from the Gujarati word “undhu” which means upside down. Traditionally
            the
            entire dish is cooked in earthen pots (called 'matlu' in Gujarati). The pots are sealed and placed upside
            down
            in a fire pit dug in the ground. The slow cooking in the earthen pot gives the dish a rustic flavor and
            taste.

            <li>Deep fry muthiyas (3-4 at a time depending on the size of a pan) over low-medium flame until they turn
                light
                golden brown and outer layer turns crispy. Don't deep fry them over high flame as they may remain
                uncooked
                from inside.</li>
            <li>Remove them using slotted spoon and transfer over paper napkin to a plate. Methi Muthiyas are ready.

                masala
                (as shown in the photo).</li>

            <li>Heat 1/2 cup oil in a 3-liter or 5-liter steel/aluminum pressure cooker over medium flame. Add a pinch

            <li>Gently mix the curry with a spatula. Do not over mix as the veggies and muthiya may break. Garnish with
                fresh coriander leaves and serve hot with poori and shrikhand in lunch.</li>
