        <p>Pabda Macher Tel Jhaal or Pabda Macher Jhol is a staple Bengali Fish Curry. Pabda is a delicate fish with
            extremely flavourful flesh. Hence Pabda Macher Kalo Jeerer Jhol is cooked light with minimal usage of
            spices.
            Surprisingly this version of Pabda Tel Jhaal requires No Onion No Garlic and No Tomato at all! The bata
            moshla/masala (freshly pounded spices) and fresh coriander leaves are the key for this fragrant curry to
            bring
            the best flavour from the pabda itself. This simple Pabda Curry is enjoyed with steaming rice, musurir dal
            (masoor dal/lentil) with dash of lemon juice and Jhiri Jhiri kore kata Alu Bhaja (fried shredded potato) and
            Potol Alu Posto on side.</p>
        <p>There is a good reason why Pabda is included in daily bengali meal. It's not only because of the taste and
            flavours but also Pabda has a good nutritional value. Being a small fish Pabda is high on potassium, sodium
            and
            magnesium to provide enough minerals to our body. Also it has high protein which is enough to fulfill the
            daily
            quota of protein intake of any full grown person. Best thing is pabda has lower fat than similar small fish
            Parshe yet provides more protein and healthy fat.</p>

        <h5>Steps:</h5>
        <hr>
        <ol class="rcp-lists">
            <li>Wash and clean fish. Marinate whole fish with 1 tsp turmeric powder, ½ tsp red chili powder, ½ tsp salt
                and
                few drops of oil. Coat fish well with the spices on both sides. Set aside for 10-15 mins.</li>

            <li>Take cumin seeds, 1 chopped green chili and chopped ginger in a small bowl. Add little water and set
                aside
                for 10 mins. Then blend to form a smooth mixture.</li>

            <li>Heat mustard oil in a large frying pan. Sprinkle ½ tsp salt in hot oil. When salt dissolves add one fish
                at
                a time very carefully in the hot oil. Be very careful as Pabda splutter in hot oil like any other cat
                fish.
                Keep the flame on simmer.</li>

            <li>Pabda is a very soft fleshed fish so it requires very little time to get cooked thoroughly. A large fish
                like mine will take 3 mins on first side and 2 mins on the second side. So you need to be very careful
                on
                the timing while frying the fish otherwise fish will fall apart (like my first one).
            </li>

            <li>Remove fish from oil and keep aside.</li>

            <li>Now transfer the same oil into a heavy bottomed pan. Fry Bori (wadi) on medium flame until nicely
                browned.
                Be careful not to burn.</li>

            <li>Add green chili and nigella seed and stir lightly.</li>

            <li>Add the cumin-ginger mixture into the hot oil and stir well to fry masala on medium flame.</li>

            <li>Add all ground spices and fry till oil separates from masala, about 3-4 mins.</li>

            <li>Add half of water and bring it boil. Adjust seasoning and add rest of water. Boil in high flame.</li>

            <li>Add fish one at a time and previously fried bori (wadi) to the boiling curry. Cook for 3-5 mins
                uncovered on
                high flame.</li>

            <li>Switch off the flame and keep the fish curry on stand by for 10-15 mins, covered.</li>

            <li>Before serving add chopped coriander leaves and serve with hot rice and dal. Enjoy!</li>
